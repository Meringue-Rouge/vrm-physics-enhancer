Adds physics colliders for bust, long hair, and arms/hands to VRoid VRM models.

Now supports long dress physics creation and custom jiggle physics for thighs, hips, etc, although that one tends to get bad results quite often, so that's a BETA feature.

You'll need the VRM add-on and a VRM 1.0 Model from VRoid Studio. This won't work for VRM 0.X models.
